### Add-GP-UCB
This is a Matlab implementation of Additive Gaussian Process Optimisation and 
Bandits. For more details please read our paper on Arxiv:

### Installation & Getting Started
- Just add all relevant paths to your Matlab workspace
- The demos directory has an example on how to use this library.
- This library is still under development and still contains some experimental
  code we used during development. We are working on a cleaner implementation.
- For questions/ bug reports please email kandasamy@cs.cmu.edu
